      <h2>Over view</h2>
      <p >Sri Lanka Railways ( SLR ) is a government department functioning under the Ministry of Transport. It is a major transport service provider and is the only rail transport organization in the country. SLR transports both passenger and freight. At its inception, railway was carrying more freight than passenger. 

In Sri Lanka, the service provided by SLR in carrying the daily commuters to their workplaces, is inevitable. Sri Lanka Railway operates approximately 396 trains which include 67 Long-Distance and 16 Intercity trains and carries about 3.72 Million passengers daily.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <img src="image/image15.jpg " width="670" height="300">
      <p>
      HistoryRail was introduced in Sri Lanka in 1864 to transport coffee from plantations in the hill country district of Kandy to the port city of Colombo on its way to Europe and the world market. The coffee blight of 1871 destroyed many a fine plantation and tea replaced coffee. With the development of tea plantations in the 1880s, the joint stock companies swallowed up the former individual proprietorship of the coffee era. Under corporate ownership and management control by companies, the process of production of tea became more sophisticated and needed more and more railways built to the Kandyan highlands. To send tea to Colombo and to transport labour, machinery, manure, rice and foodstuff, etc to Kandy, another 100 miles of railways were constructed in the tea planting districts to serve the expanding tea domain

HistoryTo serve the coconut plantations flourishing in the west, south west and north west coastal areas of the country, and the wet inland rubber plantations below the tea belt, railway lines were built in the wake of these agricultural developments. Thereafter, the need for cheap and safe travel in order to open up the hinterland of the country led to the expansion of the railway.

An extension of the Main Line to Kandy was made north to the ancient city of Anuradhapura, going further north to Kankesanturai and west to Talaimannar to connect the island with South India by ferry, to bring Indian labour for the tea and rubber plantations, and also import rice and other food stuffs not indigenously produced in sufficient quantities.
